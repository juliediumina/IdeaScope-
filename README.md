# IdeaScope-

🚀 **IdeaScope AI** is a machine learning tool designed to evaluate early-stage startup ideas using structured scoring and interpretable, tree-based models like XGBoost and Random Forest.

This project uses synthetic data **generated with generative AI** to mimic real-world startup features — making it both realistic and reproducible. Development and testing are done in **Google Colab**
---

## 🧠 Why IdeaScope?

Startup founders, students, and analysts often have great ideas — but no objective system to evaluate them. IdeaScope AI helps break down a concept into tangible, scoreable factors to provide clarity, insight, and direction.

This tool gives each idea a **score** based on multiple dimensions (market size, innovation, etc.) and explains **why** it got that score using interpretable ML.
